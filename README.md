### AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome last release:
2020-07-24 17:41:30: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.103.3:

Hotfixes are so much cooler than regular fixes:

* Regular fixes are slow, hotfixes are quick to come
* Fixing something is admitting your mistakes, hotfixing is proving you care
* Fixes bore you with long changelogs, hotfixes get straight to the point
* You can't say 'hotfix' without 'hot', and hot is cool :sunglasses:

At AdGuard, we respect coolness, that's why we only hotfix. In this one, we address a couple of bugs from v0.103.

* Several UI issues: #1926 #1934 #1927 #1922 #1916 #1921
* Dashboard is loading very slowly when there are many IP/CIDR in the "Disallowed clients" list #1920
* Fix DNS rewrites behavior for AAAA rewrites: #1918

Have a good weekend everyone!
