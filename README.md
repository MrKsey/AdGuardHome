2020-11-11 13:53:05: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.104.1:

Those who pay close attention to AdGuard Home releases know that we keep hotfixes close to our hearts üî•‚ô•Ô∏è This time we held for as long as we could, but ultimately gave in to the urge üòî

Here's a patch to v0.104 with some fixes and minor improvements.

##  Fixed

 *  Solve the `permission denied` error when launching a DHCP server on *Linux* using *Snap* (#2228).  Users experiencing this issue should refresh their snap and call:
    ```sh
    snap connect adguard-home:network-control
    ```
    This won't be required in the future versions.
 *  Use matching fonts in the *Custom Filters* textarea (#2254).
 *  Show the correct query type for DNS-over-QUIC queries in query log (#2241).
 *  Increase the default number of simultaneous requests to improve performance (#2257).
 *  Always set a secondary DNS in DHCP (#1708).
 *  Improve stability on DNS proxy restart (#2242).
 *  Improve logging on DNS proxy restart (#2252).
 *  Don't show a ‚ÄúLoading‚Äù message and don't rerequest logs once we've reached the end of logs on the query log page (#2229).
 *  Various internal improvements.
