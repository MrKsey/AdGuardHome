### Unofficial Docker Image for AdGuardHome
This is unofficial dockerized precompiled AdGuardHome within a debian:stable-slim image.

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.
