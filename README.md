2019-06-07 17:54:50: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.96-hotfix:

We have a good tradition üéÇ Whenever a new version of AdGuard Home gets released, it is required to wait one day and then release a hotfix. Because having bugs in AGH releases is a tradition, too. Hm, now that I think of it, it's not that good of a tradition ü§î In fact, I don't like it at all! üò° And you can help us get rid of it forever, now that [Beta update channel](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome#contributing) is available üéâ  

Let me now get serious for a minute and describe what was fixed in this update:

* [Fixed] An issue with forcing parental control for specific clients: [#727#issuecomment-499593806](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/727#issuecomment-499593806)
* [Fixed] Bootstrapping DOH and DOT uses system resolver on Windows: #770 
* [Fixed] Wrong URL in the certificate expiration alert: #806 

P.S. One a bright side, if you are using v0.96, you can now check out how the built-in update works. Please note that the update check is performed once in 8 hours.














2019-08-22 13:14:12: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.98.1:

A quick hotfix for a release is like a cherry on top of a tasty cake. And it turns out we are darn good cooks! üë®‚Äçüç≥ 

After this hotfix, the "Blocked services" settings won't reset every time you restart AG Home. You know, like they should have done in the first place. Bon appetit! üëå
