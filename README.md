### Unofficial Docker Image for AdGuardHome
This is unofficial dockerized precompiled AdGuardHome within a debian:stable-slim image.

Official Docker Image for AdGuardHome here - https://hub.docker.com/r/adguard/adguardhome

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.

### Requirements

* host with docker
* ~128 Mb RAM, ~100 Mb disk space 

## Usage

* docker host ip (for example) - 192.168.1.10 .
* create ```/AdGuardHome``` directory on your docker host for configuration files, filters and data.
* create container from docker image "ksey/adguardhome", connect host ```/AdGuardHome``` directory to the container directory ```/opt/AdGuardHome/data``` and start container.

Example:
```
docker pull ksey/adguardhome
docker run --name AdGuardHome -d -p 192.168.1.10:53:53/udp -p 192.168.1.10:53:53/tcp -p 3000:3000 -v /AdGuardHome:/opt/AdGuardHome/data --restart always ksey/adguardhome
```

* Open the browser and navigate to http://192.168.1.10:3000/ to control your AdGuardHome service.
* When you run AdGuard Home for the first time, there is a simple configuration wizard.
* Remember to set "Admin Web Interface" port to 3000.
* AdGuardHome DNS works on 192.168.1.10, default port 53.
* Edit file ```/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml``` (on the host) to change the password and other parameters.

### AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome last release:
2020-03-13 12:45:18: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.101.0:

Due to the coronavirus ü¶†, World Health Organization strongly recommends people to stay at homes. And just as much as means of physical protection are important to your personal health, cyber protection is crucial for the health of your home network. Under the circumstances, we decided it was high time üïõ to release the next version of AdGuard Home üè° 

And we have enough new toys to play with to keep you busy for a while!

## Filter lists

This update is all about filter lists. As you probably know, the blocking quality depends on the lists you use, and these lists are mostly maintained by a large community of volunteers üë•. Our job is to provide these people with a convenient framework, and that's what we're always striving to do.

### Client tags and `ctag` modifier support [#1081](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1081)

The `ctag` modifier allows blocking domains for specific types of DNS clients. You can assign tags to clients in AdGuardHome UI. Then, once it's done, you can create filtering rules that work for specific clients only.

For instance, here's my phone tagged as `device_phone`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5947035/76601035-2a826d80-6519-11ea-8f58-f713d2dba75d.png)

The rule `||facebook.com^$ctag=device_phone` blocks `facebook.com` for clients tagged with `device_phone` only and won't do anything to other clients üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Currently, using `ctag` requires manual configuration which might be not bad, but it's not ideal for sure. In the future, we are going to assign some tags automatically by analyzing the behavior of each client. However, we [need your help](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1468) with that.

### A tool for testing domains against Filter rules [#856](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/856)

Typing `nslookup` every time you need to test whether a domain is being blocked or not is rather tedious üò© AdGuard Home now provides a simple tool to do that right from the web admin panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5947035/76602813-c5307b80-651c-11ea-9279-c3cf25795513.png)

### Support Whitelist Lists [#822](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/822)

I am personally not a huge fan of this because modern adblock-style filter lists provide more flexible ways, but this feature is quite important to people that use humongous hosts blocklists and prefer to <s>shoot</s> üî´ block first and ask questions later. We're not here to judge, so here it goes, add your own whitelists and have fun with them! 

## We are looking for filter lists

It is time to extend the number of filter lists available by default from the UI. If you have any suggestions, [please tell us](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1325)! We're all ears üó£üëÇ

Please note, that we will prioritize lists that use the [modern syntax](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Hosts-Blocklists) compatible with AdGuard Home over simple /etc/-hosts-style lists.

### Host-lists compiler

We made a tool for filters maintainers that makes it easier to compile a new filter list compatible with AdGuard Home: https://github.com/AdguardTeam/HostlistCompiler

Here's what it can do:
* Validate filtering rules
* Remove some rules modifiers (which are more or less safe to remove)
* Transform and compress /etc/hosts lists

## Compatibility with OpenWRT

AdGuard Home is now compatible with OpenWRT. Not that it was completely incompatible before, you could always run a binary, or you could build it manually for (almost) any CPU.

The problem was that you could not install AdGuard Home as a service as per the [Getting Started](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Getting-Started) manual, and doing it manually requires some advanced technical knowledge üéì

Anyways, this is not a problem anymore! AdGuard Home can be installed on an OpenWRT device and registered as a service: [#1348](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1348), [#1386](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1386) [#1239](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/issues/1239).

And if you want better integration with OpenWRT, there is an awesome luci application by @rufengsuixing:
