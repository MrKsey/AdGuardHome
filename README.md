2020-11-20 10:40:04: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.104.3:

Bugfixes... üòå There's something about them that we just can't resist. We always want more! üßü 

When there's nothing more to fix, we just roll out a new major update, introduce some fresh bugs and start all over. It's a circle of life ‚òØÔ∏è

Luckily, there are still some to prey upon in v0.104. Have a look at what we've fixed this time:

##  Fixed

 *  Don't expose the profiler HTTP API (#2336).
 *  Load query logs from files after loading the ones buffered in memory (#2325).
 *  Don't show Unnecessary errors in logs when switching between query log files (#2324).
 *  Don't show `404 Not Found` errors on the DHCP settings page on *Windows*.  Show that DHCP is not currently available on that OS instead (#2295).
 *  Fix an infinite loop in the `/dhcp/find_active_dhcp` HTTP API method (#2301).
 *  Various internal improvements.
