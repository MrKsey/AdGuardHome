### Requirements

* host with docker
* ~128 Mb RAM, ~100 Mb disk space 

## Usage

* docker host ip (for example) - 192.168.1.10 .
* create ```/AdGuardHome``` directory on your docker host for configuration files, filters and data.
* create container from docker image "ksey/adguardhome", connect host ```/AdGuardHome``` directory to the container directory ```/opt/AdGuardHome/data``` and start container.

Example:
```
docker pull ksey/adguardhome
docker run --name AdGuardHome -d -p 192.168.1.10:53:53/udp -p 192.168.1.10:53:53/tcp -p 3000:3000 -v /AdGuardHome:/opt/AdGuardHome/data --restart always ksey/adguardhome
```

* Open the browser and navigate to http://192.168.1.10:3000/ to control your AdGuardHome service.
* When you run AdGuard Home for the first time, there is a simple configuration wizard.
* Remember to set "Admin Web Interface" port to 3000.
* AdGuardHome DNS works on 192.168.1.10, default port 53.
* Edit file ```/AdGuardHome/AdGuardHome.yaml``` (on the host) to change the password and other parameters.

### AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome last release:
2020-05-15 15:46:06: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.102.0:

Finally, it's time for the next AdGuard Home release! This time we brought you some really cool features, stay with me to learn what's that all about.

## Faster internet üöÑ

Now that sounds cool! In reality, of course, that's a combination of features aimed at increasing your connection speed. They won't magically make your already fast Internet even faster, but will help immensely those who suffer from slower connection (for example, we heard such complaints from our Chinese users).

### Fastest IP address: #715

First of all, there's a new option called **Fastest IP address**. You can enable it in the DNS settings.

<img width="681" alt="up04_AdGuard Home_xosct" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5947035/82048151-c1f07200-96bc-11ea-961b-a3326cb50510.png">

You probably have a vague idea of what it does (**IT CHOOSES THE FASTEST IP ADDRESS** üòØ), but how exactly does it work? Here's how:

1. AdGuard Home simultaneously sends your DNS query to all configured DNS servers. **Avoid using too many or too slow resolvers!**
2. It gets all IP addresses from all responses and checks which one is the fastest of all.
3. It keeps only the fastest one in the DNS response.

Overall, this would make DNS queries slightly slower, but since it chooses the fastest IP address, it may improve the internet speed. ‚öñÔ∏è

### Configurable min/max cache time-to-live: #1214 

You can now override the time-to-live values and use a larger one if necessary. This way you can reduce the overall number of DNS queries that are actually sent to remote DNS servers. 

At this moment it cannot be configured via the web interface. If you want to use it, you gotta get your hands dirty. üë∑ Edit `AdGuardHome.yaml` to change `cache_ttl_min` or `cache_ttl_max`. You can learn more about the configuration file [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Configuration#configuration-file). 

Thanks a lot to @adworacz who basically implemented this feature. üôè

### Upstream proxy settings for AdGuard Home: #458

You can configure AdGuard Home to use a proxy server for internal web requests (updating blocklists, for instance). In order to do this, set `http_proxy` in `AdGuardHome.yaml` (e.g. `http://user:password@server:port/`). Supports `http`, `https`, and `socks5` scheme.
