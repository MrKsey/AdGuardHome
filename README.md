2021-04-28 15:29:14: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.106.0:

Quite a lot of changes this time around, even if there aren't as many standouts as in some of the previous updates. We're sure that you'll be able to find a line or two in the changelog that speaks to you!

And one of the reasons for that is the constant support from the community. üë•üë• Special thanks to our open-source contributors: @jvoisin and @Paraphraser, as well as to everyone who filed issues, added translations, and helped us to test this release! üôá

### **The ability to set up custom upstreams to resolve PTR queries for local addresses and to disable the automatic resolving of clients' addresses (#2704)**

<img src="https://cdn.adguard.com/public/Adguard/Home/0.106.0/ptr.jpg?1">

This option will improve your DNS privacy when it comes to addressing local resources. Give it a go unless you want to share your private data with googles of the world.

### **Search by clients' names in the query log (#1273)**

There's not much that can be said about this feature, it's quite self-explanatory: now you can search up queries by specific clients. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

However, we wanted to highlight it anyway since so many of you have asked for it for quite a while. Hopefully, we delivered! üòÖ
