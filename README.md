### Unofficial Docker Image for AdGuardHome
This is unofficial dockerized precompiled AdGuardHome within a debian:stable-slim image.

AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads & tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.

2019-01-11 12:31:53: [AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome, RELEASE] AdGuard Home v0.92-hotfix2:

ðŸ”§ Another hotfix has arrived! ðŸ”§

It appears that v0.92 messed with the Netflix app (see #534 and #521), so we had to release one more hotfix. Hopefully, this one is the last and there will be no other problems with v0.92.

The only change is that AGH now additionally listens to TCP alongside with UDP: #521.
